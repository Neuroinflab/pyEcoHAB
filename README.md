=====================

pyEcoHAB is a Python library for loading and analyzing behavioral data obtained in experiments performed with the Eco-HAB. Eco-HAB is a system for fully automated and ecologically relevant assessment of social impairments in mice.

pyEcoHAB supports both Python2 and Python3.

pyEcoHAB allows for easy access to antenna readings. It implements a heuristic calculating timing and duration of animal visists to EcoHAB compartments. It also provides methods for determining mouse activity (number of visits and time spent in each chamber), in-cohort sociability, solitude (time mouse spent alone in EcoHAB chambers) and following.
