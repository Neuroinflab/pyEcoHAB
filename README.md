pyEcoHAB is a library for loading and analyzing behavioral data from experiments using the Eco-HAB system for investigating social interactions between mice.

pyEcoHAB works with both Python2 and Python3.

pyEcoHAB allows for easy access to antenna readings and visits to EcoHAB chambers. It also provides methods for determining mouse activity (number of visits and time spent in each chamber), in-cohort sociability, solitude (time mouse spent alone in EcoHAB chambers) and following.
